 * st7789.py -> this file contain the library of the lcd module, save the file in the raspberry pi pico
 * main.py   -> this file contain the main code, you need to run this file, you also need to save this file to Pico
 * firmware.uf2 -> by pressing bootsel of the pico and hold then connect to laptop after this a new stroage device is come, name "RPI-RP2",then  drag and drop this file to pico
 
## For setup the Board in thonny </b>
* Now connect USB Cable on USB Port of Pico.
* Open Thonny IDE and Choose interpreter as MicroPython (Raspberry Pi pico).
